Proyecto Integrador PI 
Programacion Estructurada

In my project my idea is to program the board game called connect 4. 
The game consist in a board of 7x6 that has a top and a bottom part, then at the begining 
the cells are empty and the two players must take turns to start filling it by introducing game tokens. 
The goal of the player to win is to make a row of four tokens of their belonging in the board.  
and it is played 
by two players taking turns to play
